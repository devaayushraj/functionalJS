This is the repo for all funcitonal programmming related to JavaScript.


# What is an app?
Most app are list of data presented in meaningfull way

# To be good at building an app you must be good at three things:

## DATA
## List of DATA
## DATA Transformations

# Pareto Principle : 20% of work result in 80% of result.

* _You need to know 20% of JavaScript to code 80% of any app._ *

# What are those 20% of JavaScript?

## Primitive Types
## String
## Number
## Boolean
## Undefined // Usually you don't choose it.
## null
## Arrays - A collection of anything

# Object Literals

Record is a better description of word object literals.

`const meal = {
description: 'Breakfast'
calories: 180
date: new Date(2021,0,1)
}`

# Array []

`const meal = [
  {
    description: "Breakfast",
    calories: 100,
  },
  {
    description: "Lunch",
    calories: 200,
  },
];`


#functions

allows you to reuse code and transform values

`function(){}`

# Conditional

`if{} else{}`

`? :`


# Immutable data

Data that never changes
